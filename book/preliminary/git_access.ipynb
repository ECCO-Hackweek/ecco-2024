    "\n",
    "Once you have created your token, **be sure to save it on your computer in case\n",

    "the {{hackweek}} hackweek organization via the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test your setup on the JupyterHub, we will be using a test repository from\n",
    "the UW Geohackweek organization. Enter the following command into your open\n",
    "terminal on the JupyterHub, replacing `{username}` with your GitHub username and `{TOKEN}` with the token you just created.\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "    git clone https://{username}:{TOKEN}@github.com/NASA-Openscapes/check_github_setup.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{attention}\n",
    "The inclusion of `{username}:{TOKEN}@` is optional. Typically you can clone a repository without including your credentials, but when pushing edits back to the repo GitHub will prompt you for the credentials if they are not already stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because you already set `credential.helper store` earlier, you only should need to enter these credentials once on a given machine. Next time you clone a repo, you can omit `{username}:{TOKEN}@`, for example: ```git clone https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/check_github_setup.git```.\n",

    "Now that you have entered your credentials once, you should no longer be prompted\n",
    "for your username and token again. To test the successful storage of your\n",

    "   - make sure that only you can read the private key: ```chmod 400 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519```. Otherwise you may get an error when using the key pair later.\n",
    "1. Add the new SSH public key to your GitHub account. [Detailed Instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)\n",
    "   - Log into your github account\n",
    "   - click on your profile picture (usually in the top right corner of the github page)\n",
    "   - click *Settings*\n",
    "   - click on *SSH and GPG keys* on the left hand side\n",
    "   - click on *Green button*: \"New SSH Key\"\n",
    "   - Make a title, something like *ECCO_HackWeek*\n",
    "   - Key type should be \"Authentication Key\"\n",
    "   - Copy the contents of your public key file on OSS (*id_ed25519.pub*) to the clipboard\n",
    "     - Return to the OSS JupyterLab terminal window\n",
    "     - Show the contents of the public key file to the screen: ```cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub```\n",
    "     - select the text, ```ssh-ed25519 .... your.email@example.com```, and copy (Ctrl-C or equivalent)\n",
    "   - Paste the text in the *Key* text box in the GitHub *Add new SSH Key* page\n",
    "   - Click the *Green button*: \"Add SSH key\"\n",
    "   - Verify the new key appears on the list of \"SSH keys\" on the [GitHub SSH keys page](https://github.com/settings/keys)\n",

    "### (Optional) Advanced GitHub setup\n",
