    "The P-Cluster is very much like a high-performance computing (HPC) system where you can run interactive jobs and/or perform parallel computing. Our [P-Cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/what-is-aws-parallelcluster.html) uses compute resources from the AWS cloud.\n",

    "## Connect to the P-Cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generating SSH keys\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to use ssh keys to log into the P-Cluster, there are no passwords.\n",
    "To generate ssh keys, use a tool like [ssh-keygen](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh-keygen).\n",
    "    \n",
    "```\n",
    "ssh-keygen -q -N \"\" -t rsa -b 4096 -f PATH_AND_FILENAME_OF_NEW_KEY\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```-q and -N \"\"``` arguments means stay quiet and do not use a passphrase (optional).\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace ```PATH_AND_FILENAME_OF_NEW_KEY``` to something like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ssh-keygen -q -N \"\" -t rsa -b 4096  -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_key_PCLUSTER \n",
    "```\n",
    "    \n",
    "Now you will have a pair of public and private keys at the specified location. The public key has the extension ```.pub``` and the private key has the same filename with no extension. So your PUBLIC KEY will be something like ```id_rsa_key_PCLUSTER.pub``` and your PRIVATE KEY will be something like ```id_rsa_key_PCLUSTER```. These files will be together in your key directory (e.g., ~/.ssh).\n",
    "\n",
    "```{attention}\n",
    "Before you can connect to the P-Cluster with your private key, you must send your *public* SSH key to [eccohackweek@gmail.com](mailto:eccohackweek@gmail.com) so your public key can be registered. Do not send your *private* key. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connecting to the P-Cluster using SSH and your private key\n",
    "\n",
    "From your local Linux or Mac terminal, connect to the P-Cluster via ssh using its IP address (34.210.1.198):\n",
    "```\n",
    "ssh -i /path/to/privatekey -X USERNAME@34.210.1.198\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note your USERNAME is not the same as your email address, it will be emailed to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The -X option in the ssh -X command enables X11 forwarding, allowing you to run graphical applications on a remote machine and display them locally on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you used a passphrase to create your keys then you may be prompted to enter it:\n",
    "```    \n",
    "    Enter passphrase for key '/Users/USERNAME/.ssh/id_rsa':\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you successfully log in, you will be in your home directory, /home/USERNAME/.\n",
    "The home directory is intended for storing analysis code, scripts, configurations, and user-specific settings, while the /efs_ecco/USERNAME/ directory is better suited for conducting model runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Update the .bashrc file in your P-Cluster home directory \n",
    "By default, the P-Cluster uses Bash as the shell environment. Each user has a .bashrc file in their home directory, which is automatically executed whenever a new Bash session starts.\n",
    "This file can be customized to set environment variables, create aliases, and configure other shell settings.\n",
    "Here is an [example .bashrc](../tutorials/pcluster/example.bashrc) that sets the default Bash environment on the P-Cluster.\n",
    "This [example .bashrc](../tutorials/pcluster/example.bashrc) can serve as a starting point for further customization (download it, place it in your home directory, and rename it to .bashrc).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "wget https://ecco-hackweek.github.io/ecco-2024/_downloads/108b297526785008d4bef6ddcf32cd34/example.bashrc . \n",
    "mv example.bashrc .bashrc \n",
    "```\n",
    "If preferred, users can use other shells such as Csh, Ksh, or Zsh.\n",
