    "This page will help you get set up on the Open Science Studio (OSS) system that we will use during Hackweek to work with notebooks. It also has a little background information on the OSS and JupyterHub workspaces.\n",

    "### OSS authentication setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we assume that you have already provided an e-mail to Hackweek organizers that they have shared with the SMCE tech team to set up your account. Go to https://sealevel.oss.eis.smce.nasa.gov:\n",
    "\n",
    "![OSS login page](../img/oss_login_page.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have not logged in to OSS before, click \"Forgot Password?\". You should get a page that prompts you for your username or e-mail associated with the account:\n",
    "\n",
    "![oss_forgot_password](../img/oss_forgot_password.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "After you enter your password, you should get an e-mail that prompts you to set up a password, and a token in a third-party authenticator app (e.g., Microsoft or Google Authenticator). At the link there should be a QR code that you can scan in the authenticator app of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{attention}\n",
    "The authentication for OSS is distinct from the P-Cluster, which uses an SSH key pair. See the [Getting Started with the P-Cluster](https://ecco-hackweek.github.io/ecco-2024/preliminary/pcluster-login.html) tutorial for an overview of the P-Cluster authentication process.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After setting up your two-factor authentication (password + app-based token), return to the [OSS login page](https://sealevel.oss.eis.smce.nasa.gov) and use your password to sign-in. The next page will prompt you for the token from your authenticator app:\n",

    "### JupyterHub server selection\n",
    "\n",
    "After entering your password and token, you should see a screen to select a \"server\" size for your JupyterHub:\n",
    "\n",
    "![OSS select server](../img/oss_jupyterhub_server_select.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first three options in the drop-down menu are the regular options for the OSS interface, with the larger \"ECCO Hackathon\" options provided for the use of the Hackathon this week. If you are just starting to experiment with notebooks, please select a smaller server--**Large (8GB RAM)** or **Extra Large (16GB RAM)** is fine. If you want to run a Jupyter notebook that uses 26 years of full-depth ECCO output, you will make life easier for yourself by selecting one of the larger \"ECCO Hackathon\" servers with more memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "The Python tutorials that [use ECCO output](https://ecco-hackweek.github.io/ecco-2024/tutorials/ECCO_v4_computations_index.html) in the `ecco-2024` repository all should be OK to run with as low as 8 GB of RAM, though if you want to save some time with the transport and budget tutorials you can use a larger server.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have selected a server, it will take a few minutes to allocate the resources for you and set it up. You will see a blue bar moving across the screen that helps you monitor the progress. Once the server is set up you will arrive at your JupyterHub home page, from which you can create, edit, and run notebooks, as well as work in a terminal window and create markdown files among other features.\n",
    "\n",
    "![JupyterHub home page](../img/oss_jupyterhub_home_page.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a moment to check the contents of your top-level home directory. On the left side of your screen it shows the contents of your current working directory. If you are in a subdirectory, click on the folder (annotated by the red circle above) to go to your home directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "When starting out on OSS you will not have as many directories as are shown here, but one directory you should be able to see is the `efs_ecco` directory. The `efs_ecco` volume is mounted to both OSS and P-Cluster; it's capacity is theoretically unlimited, and this is where you can store larger data files that are shared with the P-Cluster. **Please do not store large data files on OSS outside of `efs_ecco`, since the total storage capacity of the Hackweek OSS (for all users!) is 150 GB.**  If you do not see `efs_ecco` under your OSS home directory, please let one of the Hackweek organizers know.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "If you have more setup to do, feel free to proceed to the [next setup page](https://ecco-hackweek.github.io/ecco-2024/preliminary/git_access.html). Below there is some more information on what this platform is that you have just logged into.\n",
