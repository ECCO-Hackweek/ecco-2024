    "# Modified Simulation Tool\n",
    "The Modified Simulation (msim) Tool runs V4r4 with modified input. Examining the model state of a modified simulation or comparing it with that of the original V4r4 can provide important scientific insights into the impact of model input, such as climatological versus non-climatological forcings or local versus remote forcings. \n",

The total size of the output files for each simulation amounts to several hundred GBs when outputting 3D temperature and salt fluxes (see below). Be mindful when running multiple modified simulations, and contact one of the Hackathon organizers if in doubt.\n",
