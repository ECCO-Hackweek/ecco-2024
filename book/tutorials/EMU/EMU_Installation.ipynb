    "# Installation\n",
    "EMU has been pre-installed on the P-Cluster for ECCO Hackathon participants to use. Therefore, readers can skip this section. Nevertheless, we provide a detailed description of how to install EMU on the P-Cluster. These instructions can serve as guidance for users to install EMU on other P-Clusters and High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems. It is expected that some level of customization will be required on top of the steps described here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Obtain Installation Script\n",
    "First, we obtain the installation script from GitHub and prepare for the installation.\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd /efs/USERNAME\n",
    "mkdir EMU\n",
    "cd EMU\n",
    "wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ECCO-GROUP/ECCO-EIS/refs/heads/main/emu/emu_setup.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Execute Installation Script\n",
    "Then, we add executable permission to the script and run it.\n",
    "```\n",
    "chmod u+x emu_setup.sh\n",
    "./emu_setup.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choose Intalling EMU Using Singularity Image\n",
    "There are two options to install EMU: a native installation that compiles the source code on the local machine, and a [Singularity](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.5/user-guide/introduction.html) installation that uses a Singularity image. The native installation requires a [TAF](http://fastopt.com/products/taf/) license to derive the MITgcm adjoint used by EMU's Adjoint Tool, while the Singularity installation has pre-compiled executables containerized in a Singularity image and does not require a separate TAF license.\n",
    "```\n",
    "----------------------\n",
    "EMU's Programs can be installed in two different ways;\n",
    "   1) Compiling source code on host (native) \n",
    "   2) Using Singularity image (singularity)\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 1) requires a TAF license to derive the MITgcm adjoint used by EMU's \n",
    "Adjoint Tool. Option 2) has compiled versions of the code in \n",
    "containerized form that do not require a separate TAF license to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter choice for type of EMU implementation ... (1 or 2)?\n",
    "2\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation type choice is 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Specify `sbatch` as the Command for Submitting Batch Jobs\n",
    "EMU uses batch scripts to run some of its tools and requires users to specify the command for submitting batch jobs. As described in the [Getting Started with the P-Cluster](../../preliminary/pcluster-login.ipynb) tutorial, the P-Cluster uses `SLURM` as its batch system, and `sbatch` is the command we will use for submitting batch jobs.\" \n",
    "```\n",
    "----------------------\n",
    "EMU uses batch scripts to run some of its tools in PBS (Portable \n",
    "Batch System). The PBS commands in these shell scripts (pbs_*.sh),\n",

    "/efs/owang/ECCO/EMU_test/emu_userinterface_dir\n",
    "may need to be revised for different batch systems and/or different hosts. \n",
    "Alternatively, these shell scripts can be run interactively if sufficient \n",
    "resources are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter the command for submitting batch jobs (e.g., qsub, sbatch, \n",
    "bsub <, condor_submit, msub) or press the ENTER key to have EMU \n",
    "run its batch scripts interactively ... ?\n",
    "sbatch\n",

    "Command to submit EMU's batch job scripts will be: sbatch\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Downloading EMU Input Files\n",
    "The next step is to choose what input files we want to download to the P-Cluster disk. The EMU menu provides a list of options for various subsets of the input files, with the complete set totaling 1.1 TB. Below is an example for downloading all input files. If you had already downloaded the input files and want to re-install EMU (e.g., due to updates in the EMU code on its GitHub repository), you can skip downloading the input files by pressing 'Enter'. If needed, you can link the existing input files for the newly installed EMU tools (see Section [Link Existing EMU Input Files](#link-existing-emu-input-files)).\n",
