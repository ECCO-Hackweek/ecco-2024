    "# Run and Analyze Results with EMU\n",
    "In this section, we describe how to run each of the eight EMU tools. Each EMU tool has some built-in plotting scripts using Python and IDL (Interactive Data Language). We will provide examples on how to use the Python plotting script to visualize the results generated by EMU. Plotting the results using IDL can be done similarly (see /efs/owang/ECCO/EMU_test/emu_userinterface_dir/idl/README_idl).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sampling and Attribution tools are set up to run without being submitted as batch jobs using `SLURM`. However, as explained in [Getting Started with the P-Cluster](../../preliminary/pcluster-login.ipynb), we first need to request an interactive node using `salloc` instead of running directly on the head node, in order to avoid straining the head node, which has limited resources. The rest of the EMU tools are configured to be automatically submitted as a `SLURM` batch job so there is no need to use `salloc` to request an interactive node.\n",
