    "# Tracer Tool\n",
    "The Tracer (trc) Tool computes the evolution of passive tracer and its adjoint with a user-specified initial tracer and its adjoint. The tool uses the pre-computed weekly-mean ECCO V4r4 circulation and mixing to timestep the passive tracer. For this reason, we refer to the tracer as an offline passive tracer. The wall time of the model integration is significantly reduced due to the use of pre-computed circulation and mixing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to run a passive tracer initialized in the upper 10 m of the Ni&ntilde;o 3.4 region (5&deg;S-5&deg;N, 170&deg;W-120&deg;W) from day 35 to day 365. We then show how to plot some of the results. Whether the run is for a tracer or its adjoint is determined by how the start day and end day are set. If the start day (35 in this example) is earlier than the end day (365), it is a *forward* tracer. Its adjoint can be run using the same parameters, except with the start day set to 365 and the end day set to 35."
