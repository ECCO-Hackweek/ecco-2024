    "# Introduction\n",
    "ECCO Modeling Utilities (EMU) is a collection of computational tools for analyzing the ECCO model itself, in addition to its state (flux-forced Version 4 Release 4). A detailed description of the EMU tools is available in [this presentation slide deck](https://ecco-group.org/docs/01_16_fukumori_emu_ecco_2024_03.pdf). The tools (and their abbreviations) include the following:\n",
    "   1) Sampling (samp); Evaluates time-series of the model state. \n",
    "   2) Forward Gradient (fgrd); Computes state's forward gradient. \n",
    "   3) Adjoint (adj); Computes state's adjoint gradient. \n",
    "   4) Convolution (conv); Evaluates adjoint gradient decomposition.\n",
    "   5) Tracer (trc); Computes passive tracer evolution.\n",
    "   6) Budget (budg); Evaluates time-series of the state's fluxes.\n",
    "   7) Modified Simulation (msim); Runs V4r4 with modified input.\n",
    "   8) Attribution (atrb); Evaluates state time-series by control type. \n",
    "   \n",
    "The EMU code is accessible at https://github.com/ECCO-GROUP/ECCO-EIS/tree/main/emu. There is a main [README](https://github.com/ECCO-GROUP/ECCO-EIS/blob/main/emu/README) file for the EMU tools, as well as individual README files (README_***) for each tool. Additionally, EMU provides programs for interactively reading and plotting in different programming languages. For a detailed description, refer to the [EMU User Guide](https://github.com/ECCO-GROUP/ECCO-EIS/blob/main/emu/Guide_ECCO_Modeling_Utilities.pdf).\n",

    "The EMU tools are manually driven and configured with user-specified input parameters. Once configured, the tools will either run as a normal shell script or be submitted as a batch job using `SLURM` on the P-Cluster. Among these tools, the Sampling and Attribution Tools are set up to run as normal shell scripts. However, please do not run these scripts on the head node, as explained in [Getting Started with the P-Cluster](../../preliminary/pcluster-login.ipynb). You must first request an interactive node using `salloc` instead of running directly on the head node to avoid overloading it, as it has limited resources (see table below). The rest of the EMU tools are designed to be automatically submitted as `SLURM` batch jobs, so there is no need to use `salloc` to request an interactive node.\n",

    "We first create a master working directory and change into it:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mkdir -p /efs_ecco/USERNAME/ECCO/EMU/tryout\n",
    "cd /efs_ecco/USERNAME/ECCO/EMU/tryout\n",
    "```\n",
    "When running each tool, EMU will create a subdirectory in the current directory named `emu_**TOOL_ABBREVIATION**_*/`, where `**TOOL_ABBREVIATION**` is the abbreviation of each tool (as specified in the parentheses after each tool's name in the table above). The rest of the directory name (indicated by `*`) depends on the input parameters (see an example in [Sampling Tool](samp.ipynb)). Inside `emu_**TOOL_ABBREVIATION**_*/`, there are two subdirectories: `temp` and `output`. The `temp` directory is for execution, and the `output` directory is the archive directory where, after successful execution, useful output files, along with the configuration information, are stored for plotting and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "EMU also has built-in plotting tools using Python and IDL (Interactive Data Language). We will provide examples on how to use the Python plotting script to visualize the results generated by EMU. Plotting the results using IDL can be done similarly (see /efs/owang/ECCO/EMU_test/emu_userinterface_dir/idl/README_idl).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sections are organized as follows. Section [Installing EMU](EMU_Installation.ipynb) provides instructions on how to install EMU on the P-Cluster. Readers can skip this section because EMU has already been pre-installed on the P-Cluster for ECCO Hackathon participants. The remaining sections are organized by EMU tools, with one tool per section. In each section, we describe how to run an EMU tool as well as how to use the built-in Python plotting tool to visualize the results. "
