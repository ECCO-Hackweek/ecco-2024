    "# Using *git* to commit and publish code\n",
    "\n",
    "For newcomers to Github, this tutorial covers some of the basic git commands that you can use to manage code changes in a given repository, and publish those changes. To illustrate this process, we will make some \"test\" changes to the `example` tutorial notebook. For further reference, the [Atlassian Git tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes) is a good resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting ready to make changes to a repo\n",
    "\n",
    "The following schematic illustrates the steps that a user might take before making code changes that will be contributed back to the shared remote repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Getting ready to write and edit](../img/git_workflow_start.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [previous tutorial](./oss_initial_repo.ipynb) the setup included the first two steps: (1) **forking** the repo so that you have an individually-owned repo to base your changes, and (2) **cloning** that repo so you have it on your local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a branch\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing or revising code (including Jupyter notebooks), it is a good practice to first create a branch. Each branch is a place where you make a coherent set of changes to a repo (e.g., writing a new notebook, adding a new feature to your code). This helps organize contributions when they are merged into the remote repo. Let's open a terminal window in JupyterHub and navigate to the `ecco-2024` directory/repo: ```cd ~/ecco-2024```. We can make sure we are in the `ecco-2024` repo by running the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git status\n",
    "\n",
    "$output\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This confirms that you are in the `main` branch of the `ecco-2024` repository, and any changes you make will be implemented in that branch. But now we create a \"topic\" branch called `test_changes`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git branch test_changes\n",
    "\n",
    "$output\n",
    "\n",
    "git branch -a\n",
    "\n",
    "$output\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The last command `git branch -a` shows all the branches that *git* is aware of for this repository, on both local and remote repos. We can see the new branch created in this list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a quick check of `git status` shows that you are not *in* the new branch yet, and any changes you make will still be associated with the `main` branch. So let's move to the new branch using `git checkout`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git status\n",
    "\n",
    "$output\n",
    "\n",
    "git checkout test_changes\n",
    "\n",
    "$output\n",
    "\n",
    "git status\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We have confirmed that we are now working in the `test_changes` branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">Note: It's a good idea to check `git status` frequently while working in your repo, and definitely before you add or commit any changes you have made. `git status` will quickly tell you what branch you are working in and which files have changes pending, or are not yet tracked by *git*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Making changes in a git repo\n",
    "\n",
    "### Change the `example` notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we're going to make a small change to the `example` tutorial notebook. In the JupyterHub left sidebar, navigate to the `ecco-2024/book/tutorials/oss_setup` folder if you are not there already, and double-click on the `example.ipynb` notebook to open it.\n",
    "\n",
    "{Instructions on changes}. Now save your changes (using **Ctrl-S** or equivalent).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Move between branches\n",
    "\n",
    "![Moving around your local repo](../img/git_workflow_navigate.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A check of `git status` in the terminal window shows that the `example.ipynb` tutorial has indeed been modified in your working directory, but these changes have not been committed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git status\n",
    "\n",
    "$output\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To put it another way, the `HEAD` \"reference pointer\" for the current branch is still pointing to the notebook before it was changed. If we leave this branch and move back to `main` or another branch, the changes that you have made could in theory disappear. (In practice, *git* is very good about warning you and not letting you make mistakes like this.) So before we leave this branch we can \"stash\" our working directory changes, so we can restore them when we return.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git stash\n",
    "\n",
    "$output\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it is safe to leave the branch (you can check `git status` to be sure). Let's go back to the `main` branch:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git checkout main\n",
    "\n",
    "$output\n",
    "\n",
    "git status\n",
    "\n",
    "$output\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that the `main` branch doesn't have any of the changes we made on the other branch. You can open up the `example.ipynb` notebook to verify this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now return to the `test_changes` branch:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git checkout test_changes\n",
    "\n",
    "$output\n",
    "\n",
    "git status\n",
    "\n",
    "$output\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`git status` reminds us that we have stashed changes in this branch! Let's restore them to our working directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git stash pop\n",
    "\n",
    "$output\n",
    "\n",
    "git status\n",
    "\n",
    "$output\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And now we can see our changes again.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sharing changes with the \"upstream\" repo\n",
    "\n",
    "![Sharing your changes](../img/git_workflow_share.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get the changes we just made into the source \"upstream\" repo, there are four steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stage your changes (preparing to make a commit)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Commit your changes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Push your branch with the changes to your remote repo (\"origin\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- Merging the branch into the source \"upstream\" repo\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage and commit changes\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can share the changes we have made with the source repo, we need to \"commit\" them to the branch we have been working on. Making a \"commit\" means we are moving the `HEAD` reference pointer for the branch to include the changes, so that when the branch is pushed or merged elsewhere these changes are included. Making a \"commit\" also provides a chance to include a short message explaining what feature is being added, or bug is being fixed, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before committing the changes we need to stage them. Use `git add` to stage the changes in our notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd ~/ecco-2024/book/tutorials/oss_setup/\n",
    "git add example.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "$output\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    ">Note: Why are \"staging\" and \"committing\" two separate steps? Sometimes you may have made changes in a working directory that you want to log as two or more commits, since they deal with different features or issues. So you can add the files for one commit and carry out that commit, and then repeat the process for another commit."
