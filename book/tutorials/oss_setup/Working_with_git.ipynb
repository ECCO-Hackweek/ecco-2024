    "Andrew Delman, 2024-09-29\n",
    "\n",
    "For newcomers to Github, this tutorial covers some of the basic git commands that you can use to manage code changes in a given repository, and publish those changes. To illustrate this process, we will make some \"test\" changes to the `example` tutorial notebook. For further reference, the [Atlassian Git tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes) is a good resource.\n",

    "![Getting ready to write and edit](../figures/git_workflow_start.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [previous tutorial](./oss_initial_repo.ipynb) the setup included the first two steps: (1) **forking** the repo so that you have an individually-owned repo to base your changes, and (2) **cloning** that repo so you have it on your local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a branch\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing or revising code (including Jupyter notebooks), it is a good practice to first create a branch. Each branch is a place where you make a coherent set of changes to a repo (e.g., writing a new notebook, adding a new feature to your code). This helps organize contributions when they are merged into the remote repo. Let's open a terminal window in JupyterHub and navigate to the `ecco-2024` directory/repo: ```cd ~/ecco-2024```. We can make sure we are in the `ecco-2024` repo by running the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(notebook) jovyan@jupyter-adelman:~/ecco-2024$ git status\n",

    "Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.\n",
    "\n",
    "nothing to commit, working tree clean\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This confirms that you are in the `main` branch of the `ecco-2024` repository, and any changes you make will be implemented in that branch. But now we create a \"topic\" branch called `test_changes`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that a quick check of `git status` shows that you are not *in* the new branch yet, and any changes you make will still be associated with the `main` branch. So let's move to the new branch using `git checkout`.\n",

    "While you are working, other contributors may be merging their changes into the shared upstream repo. If you and other contributor(s) are working on the same file, then you may have a merge conflict between the two sets of changes.

While the first method is simpler, the second can be useful if you want to \"fetch\" a record of the changes to your local machine first, and then merge later (e.g., when you may not have an Internet connection). The last method is different in that it will overwrite the local branch with the remote; this can result in cleaner updates but local work can potentially be lost, so use with caution.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Note: `git pull` and `git merge` will both attempt what is called a fast-forward merge, but this is only possible if updated commits from the remote branch can be smoothly replayed on the local branch.
