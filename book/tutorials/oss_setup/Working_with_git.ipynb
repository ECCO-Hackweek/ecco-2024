    "# Using *git* to commit and publish code\n",
    "\n",
    "For newcomers to Github, this tutorial covers some of the basic git commands that you can use to manage code changes in a given repository, and publish those changes. For further reference, the [Atlassian Git tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes) is a good resource.\n",

    "## Creating a branch\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing or revising code (including Jupyter notebooks), it is a good practice to first create a branch. Each branch is a place where you make a coherent set of changes to a repo (e.g., writing a new notebook, adding a new feature to your code). When you eventually merge a branch to the main repo via a pull request, each branch represents an easily-summarized idea that you have implemented in the repo."
