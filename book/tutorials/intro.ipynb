    "This page contains a few tutorials to help you get oriented with our working environment and the ECCO model output. Hackweek tutorials are learning-oriented and guide participants through a step-wise process with a meaningful outcome. If you develop a notebook during the hackweek that you think would be a good tutorial for other participants, you can contribute it to the [`ecco-2024/book/tutorials`](https://github.com/ECCO-Hackweek/ecco-2024/tree/main/book/tutorials) directory. See the [Hackweek Guidebook](https://guidebook.hackweek.io/training/tutorials/index.html) for some useful guidelines on creating tutorials.\n",
