    "\n",
    "Your OSS account does not have any github repositories cloned by default. The \"ECCO-v4-Python Tutorial\" contains a set of Jupyter Notebooks tutorials for analyzing ECCO V4 solutions. To have a local copy of the ECCO-v4-Python Tutorial we suggest that you fork and clone the repo to your OSS account.\n",

    "Forking and cloning a repository is beneficial because it:\n",
    "- Forking allows you to create your own copy of a project under your GitHub account.\n",
    "- You can freely experiment, make changes, and develop features without affecting the original project.\n",
    "- After cloning the forked repository, you can sync updates from the original repository and contribute back via pull requests.\n",
