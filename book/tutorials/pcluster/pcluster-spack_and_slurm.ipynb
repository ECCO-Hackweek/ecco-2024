    "## The Spack Package Manager\n",
    "\n",
    "*Spack is a flexible package manager designed for building and managing multiple software versions in high-performance computing environments. It allows users to easily install software with different configurations, dependencies, and compilers without interference between installations. Spack supports reproducibility and portability, making it ideal for complex scientific workflows across different systems.* - ChatGPT\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting up your environment for Spack\n",
    "The [example .bashrc](./example.bashrc) initializes Spack profile. One can use Spack to install software and generate new modules even as a non-root user, although the collection of modules on the P-Cluster is already extensive.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding software to your environment using the `module` Command\n",
    "\n",
    "The `module` command is used on the P-Cluster to manage environment modules. Modules allow users to easily load, unload, and switch between different software environments without manually modifying environment variables like `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` manually. This command is especially useful for managing multiple versions of software or libraries in shared environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you load a module, it configures your environment to use a specific version of software. You can list available modules, load and unload modules, and reset your environment using various `module` subcommands.\n",

    "\n",
    "On SLURM systems, a \"partition\" is a set of compute nodes grouped for specific job submissions. Partitions define a collection of resources with particular attributes or policies where jobs are submitted, such as job limits or access to specific hardware resources. The equivalent to \"partition\" on [PBS (Portable Batch System)](https://altair.com/pbs-professional) the \"queue.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "After issuing the `salloc` command, and waiting a few minutes, one would receive the following message on the screen with a job identification number (ID), as shown below (using 123 as an example ID):\n",
    "```\n",
    "salloc: Granted job allocation 128\n",
    "salloc: Waiting for resource configuration\n",
    "```\n",
    "**`Slurm` may take several minutes to allocate and configure the requested resources.** Once the resources are ready, the prompt will appear as follows:\n",

    "USERNAME@ip-10-20-22-69:~$ \n",

    "Then, one can run command or executable scripts. If the interactive node is no longer needed, use `scancel JOB_ID` to exit the partition and return the requested resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to `salloc`, `srun` can also be used to request an interactive node, though it is often used to run a specific script or job. `salloc`, on the other hand, allows users to run multiple commands once the resources are allocated."
