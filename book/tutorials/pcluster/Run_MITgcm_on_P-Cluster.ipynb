    "# Conducting MITgcm Verification Experiments\n",
    "## MITgcm\n",
    "MITgcm (Massachusetts Institute of Technology General Circulation Model) is a powerful and versatile numerical modeling tool used to \n",
    "simulate the circulation of the oceans, atmosphere, and climate systems. It serves as the primary numerical model for the Estimating the \n",
    "Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) project. The MITgcm user manual and code are publicly accessible at \n",
    "[MITgcm User Manual](https://mitgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [MITgcm GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MITgcm/MITgcm), respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "MITgcm includes a set of verification experiments designed to help new users become familiar with the model while also providing sufficient \n",
    "features for experienced users and developers to test new functionalities, facilitate debugging, and more.  \n",
    "\n",
    "[Section 5.5 of the MITgcm user manual](https://mitgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/contributing.html) provides detailed information \n",
    "about the verification experiments, including the `testreport` shell script utility, which generates executables, conducts runs, and \n",
    "compares the results with the benchmark results provided in the MITgcm repository. This documentation explains how to conduct these \n",
    "verification experiments on the P-Cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Get the MITgcm Code from GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "Log in to the P-Cluster using the following command:\n",
    "`ssh -i /path/to/privatekey -X USERNAME@34.210.1.198`\n",
    "\n",
    "Once logged in, clone the MITgcm code from GitHub and navigate to the directory where the verification experiments reside:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd /efs/USERNAME/\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/MITgcm/MITgcm.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conducting Verification Experiments Using Testreport Utility\n",
    "As an example, we use the shell script `testreport` to conduct the verification experiment `global_ocean.90x40x15`. Note that the names \n",
    "of the verification experiments are the same as the directory names. Additionally, each verification experiment may have multiple \n",
    "sub-experiments \n",
    "that test different MITgcm features.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Request an Interactive Node\n",
    "As explained in the [P-Cluster introduction section](../../preliminary/pcluster-login.ipynb), we first need to request an interactive node in order not to strain the head node, which has very limited resources. To do this, issue the following command: \n",
    "\n",
    "```salloc --ntasks=4 --ntasks-per-node=4 --time=01:00:00```\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait for the node to become available (when the prompt appears), then proceed to the next step below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conduct Verification Experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd MITgcm/verification\n",
    "./testreport -t \"global_ocean.90x40x15\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After the experiment completes, `testreport` generates a summary of the status of the experiment, indicating whether the test\n",
    "passes or fails. A test passes if the results are sufficiently similar to the benchmark results, and it fails if the deviation exceeds \n",
    "an acceptable threshold.. Below is a snippet of the summary, which \n",
    "shows that there are three sub-experiments: `global_ocean.90x40x15`, `global_ocean.90x40x15.dwnslp`, and `global_ocean.90x40x15.idemix`. All \n",
    "three sub-experiments have passed the test (indicated by the word `pass`).\n",
