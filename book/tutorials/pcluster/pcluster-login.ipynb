    "After running the command, ssh-keygen will prompt you with a series of questions, including where to save the public/private key pair and whether to use a passphrase. It will suggest saving the keys in ```~/.ssh/```, with filenames ```id_rsa``` (private key) and ```id_rsa.pub``` (public key) but you can specify a different location and filenames. You will also be prompted to enter a passphrase, which is an option to add an extra layer of security (you will need to enter it each time you use the key). If you prefer not to use a passphrase, simply press *Enter* twice when prompted by ssh-keygen.\n",

    "## P-Cluster Overview\n",
    "### Directory Structure\n",
    "Once you successfully log in, you will be in your home directory, /home/USERNAME/. Each user also has a directory at /efs/USERNAME/. The home directory is intended for storing analysis code, scripts, configurations, and user-specific settings, while the /efs/USERNAME/ directory is better suited for conducting model runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shell Environment \n",
    "By default, the P-Cluster uses Bash as the shell environment. Each user has a .bashrc file in their home directory, which is automatically executed whenever a new Bash session starts. This file can be customized to set environment variables, create aliases, and configure other shell settings. Here is an [example .bashrc](./example.bashrc) that sets the default Bash environment on the P-Cluster. This [example .bashrc](./example.bashrc) can serve as a starting point for further customization (download it, place it in your home directory, and rename it to .bashrc).\n",
    "\n",
    "If preferred, users can switch to other shells such as Csh, Ksh, and Zsh. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Spack\n",
    "The P-Cluster uses Spack (https://spack.io), an open-source package manager, to manage modules and libraries. The [example .bashrc](./example.bashrc) initializes Spack profile. One can use Spack to install software and generate new modules even as a non-root user, although the collection of modules on the P-Cluster is already extensive.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### The `module` Command\n",
    "\n",
    "The `module` command is used on the P-Cluster to manage environment modules. Modules allow users to easily load, unload, and switch between different software environments without manually modifying environment variables like `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` manually. This command is especially useful for managing multiple versions of software or libraries in shared environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you load a module, it configures your environment to use a specific version of software. You can list available modules, load and unload modules, and reset your environment using various `module` subcommands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a list of common `module` commands and their functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Command             | Description                                                                            | Example                    |\n",

    "| `module load`       | Loads a specific module into your environment, making the software available for use.   | `module load gcc/9.3.0`    |\n",
    "| `module unload`     | Unloads a specific module, removing it from your environment.                           | `module unload gcc/9.3.0`  |\n",
    "| `module purge`      | Unloads all currently loaded modules, resetting your environment.                       | `module purge`             |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Batch System\n",

    "| `srun`    | Submits a job or launches parallel tasks (can be used in a script or interactively). | `srun --ntasks=4 ./my_program`|\n",
    "| `scancel` | Cancels a pending or running job.                                           | `scancel <job_id>`                     |\n",
