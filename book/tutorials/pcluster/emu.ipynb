    "# Using ECCO Modeling Utility (EMU) Tools on P-Cluster\n",
    "EMU is a collection of computational tools for analyzing the ECCO model itself, in addition to its state (flux-forced Version 4 Release 4). The tools (and their abbreviations) include the following;\n",
    "   1) Sampling (samp); Evaluates time-series of the model state. \n",
    "   2) Forward Gradient (fgrd); Computes state's forward gradient. \n",
    "   3) Adjoint (adj); Computes state's adjoint gradient. \n",
    "   4) Convolution (conv); Evaluates adjoint gradient decomposition.\n",
    "   5) Tracer (trc); Computes passive tracer evolution.\n",
    "   6) Budget (budg); Evaluates time-series of the state's fluxes.\n",
    "   7) Modified Simulation (msim); Runs V4r4 with modified input.\n",
    "   8) Attribution (atrb); Evaluates state time-series by control type. \n",
    "   \n",
    "The EMU code is accessible at https://github.com/ECCO-GROUP/ECCO-EIS/tree/main/emu. There is a main [README](https://github.com/ECCO-GROUP/ECCO-EIS/blob/main/emu/README) file for the EMU tools, as well as individual README files (README_***) for each tool. Additionally, EMU provides programs for interactively reading and plotting in different programming languages. For a detailed description, refer to the [EMU User Guide](https://github.com/ECCO-GROUP/ECCO-EIS/blob/main/emu/Guide_ECCO_Modeling_Utilities.pdf).\n",

    "## Installing EMU\n",
    "### Obtain Installation Script\n",
    "First, we obtain the installation script from GitHub and prepare for the installation.\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd /efs/USERNAME\n",
    "mkdir EMU\n",
    "cd EMU\n",
    "wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ECCO-GROUP/ECCO-EIS/refs/heads/main/emu/emu_setup.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Execute Installation Script\n",
    "Then, we add executable permission to the script and run it.\n",
    "```\n",
    "chmod u+x emu_setup.sh\n",
    "./emu_setup.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choose Intalling EMU Using Singularity Image\n",
    "There are two options to install EMU: a native installation that compiles the source code on the local machine, and a [Singularity](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.5/user-guide/introduction.html) installation that uses a Singularity image. The native installation requires a [TAF](http://fastopt.com/products/taf/) license to derive the MITgcm adjoint used by EMU's Adjoint Tool, while the Singularity installation has pre-compiled executables containerized in a Singularity image and does not require a separate TAF license.\n",
    "```\n",
    "----------------------\n",
    "EMU's Programs can be installed in two different ways;\n",
    "   1) Compiling source code on host (native) \n",
    "   2) Using Singularity image (singularity)\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 1) requires a TAF license to derive the MITgcm adjoint used by EMU's \n",
    "Adjoint Tool. Option 2) has compiled versions of the code in \n",

    "### Specify `sbatch` as the Command for Submitting Batch Jobs\n",
    "EMU uses batch scripts to run some of its tools and requires users to specify the command for submitting batch jobs. As described in the [Getting Started with the P-Cluster](./pcluster-login.ipynb) tutorial, the P-Cluster uses `Slurm` as its batch system, and `sbatch` is the command we will use for submitting batch jobs.\" \n",

    "The next step is to choose which input files we want to download to the P-Cluster disk. We will select the option to skip downloading EMU input files to the P-Cluster disk by pressing the 'Enter' key, as these files have already been downloaded by the hackathon organizers to save time and disk space by avoiding redundant copies on the P-Cluster disk.\n",
